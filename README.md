# Vim Projects

These are links to projects from the ["Usage and scripting of Vim"](https://vim-fmi.bg/) course of the Sofia University in Bulgaria.

The elective course includes 15(ish) lectures spread out over 4 months or so. The students have short daily assignments to practice using Vim, and, at the end, present a project of their own choosing using Vimscript.

Be advised that the projects are not necessarily directly installable as plugins -- they were built as assignments with time pressure, and "works on my machine" was an accepted condition. They might define global functions or use windows-specific paths, for instance.
